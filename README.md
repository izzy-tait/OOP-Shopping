# OOP-Shopping
This is a Shopping Cart Application made for my Object-Oriented Programming class.
It was written in Java, with the User Interface using Java Swing elements. The program 
was designed with OOP Priniciples in mind. This program was designed with five design patterns. 
My team and I listed system requirements, made UML Diagrams, and made Sequence Diagrams before 
coding this project.
